PART A — Three-hour solo project (70 marks)
Duration: 180 minutes. Build a command-line Campus Resource Management System in Python. Complete the required demonstration.
Project scenario and functionality
Learn2Earn lends equipment to fellows. Build a working Python program that stores resource inventory, issues items, accepts returns, searches inventory and produces accurate reports.

REQUIREMENTS (70 marks):
1. Resource inventory (10): Every resource has unique ID, name, category, total units and available units. Add and list resources; reject duplicate IDs.
2. Borrowing (15): Check fellow ID and resource ID; quantity must be a positive integer and no greater than stock. Log every successful borrowing and reduce availability. Rejected attempts must not mutate state.
3. Returns (10): Only return quantities a fellow currently has on loan; update both borrowing records and inventory.
4. Search/filter (10): Case-insensitive name search; filter by category.
5. Reports (15): Show total units, available units, units currently borrowed, resources with fewer than 3 available units, and the resource with most units currently borrowed. If tied, identify all tied leaders.
6. Structure/robustness (10): Meaningful functions, menu that loops until exit, input validation and helpful errors.

No frameworks, databases, external services, or third-party packages required. Use Python standard library only. Your application should run locally.
Starting data
resources = [
  {"id": "R001", "name": "Laptop", "category": "Electronics", "total": 10, "available": 10},
  {"id": "R002", "name": "Keyboard", "category": "Accessories", "total": 5, "available": 5},
  {"id": "R003", "name": "Headset", "category": "Accessories", "total": 3, "available": 3}
]
fellows = {"F001": "Ada", "F002": "John", "F003": "Grace"}
borrow_records = []

REQUIRED DEMONSTRATION, IN ORDER:
1. F001 borrows 2 laptops — available laptop units = 8.
2. F002 borrows 3 keyboards — available keyboard units = 2.
3. F001 returns 1 laptop — available laptop units = 9.
4. F003 requests 4 headsets — rejected without changing stock.
5. F002 tries to return 4 keyboards — rejected without changing stock.
6. Search for LAPtop — find Laptop, ignoring case.
7. Generate the report — overall units 18, available 14, borrowed 4, Keyboard low stock (2); Keyboard is most borrowed (3).

Optional bonus, maximum 5 bonus marks outside 100: persist and reload inventory and loans using JSON.
